# color_themes

Digital designers are often tasked with creative image selection and color theme creation as a part of thier design process. In this creative application, we have integrated multiple Third-party APIs to allow designers to access existing image and color theme data by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Our API's both function for free and utilize existing image and color theme selection aimed at aiding these users with the digital design process. Image selection is handled via Unsplash API and color themes via a color-picker widget and The Color API. Application allows creative design through insprational image searches, color selection and color theme searches. Application focuses on and functions by use of and retrieving data from these APIs and widgets to display results for our users. Our application is free to use and saves existing color searches (Hex Value) to local storage for future reference.
